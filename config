    #Fields are MINUTE, HOUR, DAY_OF_MONTH, MONTH, DAY_OF_WEEK
    #`*` means "every value", `1,2` means "1 or 2", `2-5` means "2, 3, 4, or 5"
    #`*/2` means "every even value", `10-30/5` means "10, 15, 20, 25, or 30"
    #If MONTH or DAY_OF_WEEK fields are a constant, their first three letters suffice
        #e.g. `JAN` or `Sun` but not `Mon-Fri`; values are also case-insensitive

#Set contact/storage variables
#Variable names are case insensitive
#`dir` is the only variable that is necessary
