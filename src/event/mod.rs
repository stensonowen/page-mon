/* BS:
 *  The biggest thing that a Command object needs to do is, given its 
 *  internal data and the current time, return the next time it should run.
 *  There seem to be two ways of approaching this.
 *  1. each vector of Values is consolidated into a hash set of valid times:
 *      this would be slightly costly in terms of initial construction and 
 *      memory usage, but fetching the 'next' valid value would be very fast.
 *      5 hash tables large enough to store `*****` is 263 bytes (134 u8s)
 *  2. fetch the 'next' valid value for each Value in the vector. that would
 *      require implementing 'next' for Asterisk, Range, Constant, and Skip.
 *      This would require less memory but maybe a little more cpu to find 
 *      'next' an arbitrary (though effectively like 1 or 2) number of times.
 *      It might be in our best interest to consolidate values also (e.g. 
 *      `2,1-3` and `1-3,3-4` are redundant), but I'm not sure how I'd do that.
 *  (1) would probably be simpler, cleaner, and less interesting.
