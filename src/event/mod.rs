/* BS:
 *  The biggest thing that a Command object needs to do is, given its 
 *  internal data and the current time, return the next time it should run.
 *  There seem to be two ways of approaching this.
 *  1. each vector of Values is consolidated into a hash set of valid times:
 *      this would be slightly costly in terms of initial construction and 
 *      memory usage, but fetching the 'next' valid value would be very fast.
 *      5 hash tables large enough to store `*****` is 263 bytes (134 u8s)
 *  2. fetch the 'next' valid value for each Value in the vector. that would
 *      require implementing 'next' for Asterisk, Range, Constant, and Skip.
 *      This would require less memory but maybe a little more cpu to find 
 *      'next' an arbitrary (though effectively like 1 or 2) number of times.
 *      It might be in our best interest to consolidate values also (e.g. 
 *      `2,1-3` and `1-3,3-4` are redundant), but I'm not sure how I'd do that.
 *  (1) would probably be simpler, cleaner, and less interesting.

    //If the result is â‰¤ current, then this field overflowed by 1.
    //Can be buggy on the month field when the max varies. Might
    // not overflow predictably.
    //
    //So I spent a full day trying to implement the next_month() corner
    //case because not all months have the same number of days before
    //realizing I didn't need to, so I'm going to explain myself.
    //The way next() works is by checking the minimum value that's in
    //range and higher than `current`, and if no such number exists it 
    //returns the minimum valid value. Ordinarily, next() doesn't need
    //to track overflow because next() overflowed by 1 if next<=current
    //and 0 otherwise. However, because some months have fewer than 31 
    //days, sometimes a Value (e.g. 30) is only valid for certain months.
    //Thus not only would next() have to check with a variable `max`, 
    //it would also have to keep track of the number of times it over-
    //flowed. However, the Gregorian calendar taketh away, but it also
    //giveth: there are no consecutive months that both do not have the
    //maximum number of days (31). That means this bug will never happen,
    //because if the current month has 31 days ...
    //dammit
    //Scratch that. If we have `@monthly` and it's Jan 30, then next() 
    //yields Feb 30, and correcting that results in an overflow by 2.
    //So.
    //next() is almost always right. It can be wrong if the month after 
    //the `current` month has fewer days than the upper limit of the range. 
    //This is easier to fix. Instead of writing a new function to generate
    //the next, we can take the final date with all relevant fields 
    //updated and verify that it's valid. If it's invalid, we call next()
    //on the date field at most 3 more times until the date is valid.
    //The worst case scenario (next()ing 3 times) is when `current` is 
    //January and `range.end` is 31 (and `range.start`<29): then next()
    //gives us Feb 29, which is invalid (usually), and next() gives 
    //Feb 30, Feb 31, and finally Mar N. Mar N is guaranteed to be valid 
    //because March has 31 days and each next() overflows by at most 1.
